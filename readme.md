# PG6301 Exam April 2020
For this exam I have chosen the theme Jojo Bizarre's Adventure. The concept I have used for this Gacha game is a type of cookie clicker where you click on a button x amount of times until you have enough to roll for more characters.

For the requirements that I have and have not completed/tried are:

R1 (Completed)

R2 (Completed Partly)

R3 (Did not Try)

R4 (Did not Try)

R5 (Did not Try)

T1 (Completed)

T2 (Completed)

T3 (Not Tried since lack of authentication functionality)

T4 (Not Tried)

T5 (Not Tried)

T6 (Not Tried)

Currently there are no known bugs that I have seen.
The list on the list page I had a problem fetching from the database so i had to hardcode the list to save time.
And when you try to buy 3 more characters after you've already bought them it won't show up since they are technically hardcoded into the game. They are only showed due to being and on switch(buy more character > 1).
I also had some trouble with listing the list downwards instead of sideways.

Most of the code I have re-used from the lecture and I will try to link them in the code as accordingly but I might have forgotten some.
